# Molecular Similarity





## Metric

###  Tanimoto coefficient

The definition of the ratio is the number of common bits, divided by the number of bits set (*i.e.* nonzero) in either sample.
$$
T_s(X,Y) = \frac{\sum_{i}(X_i \land Y_i)}{\sum_i{(X_i \lor Y_i)}}
$$



**Applications**

- Similarity search and virtual screening
- Chemical similarity network
