### Open reading frame identification

Open reading frames were predicted in 3376 reference bacterial genomes using Prodigal version 2.6.3 with default parameters.

### Protein family identification

Protein family domains were identified using HMMER, hmmscan version 3.1b2, and the Pfam database version 31.

### Pfam2vec implementation

Convert sequences of Pfam domain identifiers to 100-dimensions numeric vector representations using skipgram architecture of word2vec algorithm.
